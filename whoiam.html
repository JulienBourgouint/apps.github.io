<h3> I'm using exclusively python for that. </h3>

<h3> <a href="https://projecteuler.net"> Project Euler </a> is a webpage with math / programming problems </h3>
<h3> Concretely, each of the problem is a little mathematical question which you solve by entering the unique solution which is normally an integer or a float with given precision</h3>
<h3> In most cases, a naive program would solve the problem for a low input which are shown in the formulation so you can make sure you understood the problem correctly.
Then the intesting part starts where you need to make a program which complexity goes well for an higher input </h3>
